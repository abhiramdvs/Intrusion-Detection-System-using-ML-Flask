          remains. The dataset contains 43 features per record, with 41 of the
          features referring to the traffic input itself and the last two are

            This dataset contains 4 different classes of attacks. Denial of
            Service (DOS), Probe, User to Root (U2R), Remote to Local (R2L). A
            brief description about these attacks is given below:
          </p>
          <p>
            A <strong>Denial of Service (DoS)</strong> attack aims to overwhelm
            a system, network, or service by flooding it with a massive volume
            of requests, causing it to become unavailable to users.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <strong>Probe</strong> attack involves an attacker actively
            scanning a network or system to identify vulnerabilities, open
            ports, or weaknesses without launching a direct assault.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a <strong>Remote to Local (R2L)</strong> attack, an unauthorized
            user attempts to gain access to a system by exploiting
            vulnerabilities in remote services or applications. The attacker
            aims to escalate privileges or gain unauthorized access to the
            targeted system, typically through vulnerabilities in network
            services.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <strong>User to Root (U2R)</strong> attack occurs when an intruder
            with limited access attempts to elevate their privileges to gain
            full control over a system. The attacker tries to exploit
            vulnerabilities or weaknesses to escalate their privileges from a
            regular user to a superuser (root/administrator), allowing them to
            control the entire system.

            Protocol Data Distribution Chart
          </h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            In this dataset, there are 3 protocols that reflects the diverse set
            of communication methods and applications interacting across the
            network. A brief description about these protocols is given below:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>TCP</strong> is a connection-oriented protocol used for
            reliable and ordered communication between devices on a network. It
            ensures that data is delivered accurately and in the correct order
            by establishing a connection before data transfer and implementing
            error-checking mechanisms.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>UDP</strong> is a connectionless protocol that provides a
            faster but less reliable form of communication compared to TCP. It
            does not establish a connection before transmitting data and does
            not guarantee the order or delivery of packets. UDP is often used
            for real-time applications where low latency is crucial.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>ICMP</strong> is a network layer protocol used for error
            reporting, diagnostics, and managing network communications. It is
            commonly associated with utilities like Ping and Traceroute,
            providing information about network conditions and troubleshooting
            connectivity issues.

            Model Accuracy Chart with F1 - Score
          </h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            F1 score is a machine learning evaluation metric that measures a
            model's accuracy. It combines the precision and recall scores of a
            model. The accuracy metric computes how many times a model made a
            correct prediction across the entire dataset. 3 Models are used in
            this prediction and a brief description about these models is given
            below:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Decision Trees</strong> are supervised learning algorithms
            that make decisions based on a series of hierarchical, tree-like
            structures. Each node in the tree represents a decision based on a
            feature, and the branches represent the possible outcomes or
            decisions. Decision Trees are versatile, easy to understand, and
            applicable to both classification and regression tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>k-Nearest Neighbors</strong> is a simple and intuitive
            classification algorithm. It classifies a data point based on the
            majority class of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space. The
            choice of the parameter k determines the number of neighbors
            considered for classification.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Logistic Regression</strong> is a classification algorithm
            used for binary and multi-class classification problems. It models
            the probability that a given instance belongs to a particular class.
            Logistic Regression applies the logistic function to a linear
            combination of input features, mapping the result to a probability
            between 0 and 1.
